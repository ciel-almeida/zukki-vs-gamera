# Zukki vs The Great Devil Turtle Gamera

### Concept and Inicial Idea

This is a website made just to have fun and practice a little bit of css animations. The idea came after I first saw the photo of Mizuki Yamashita and the statue of Gamera, I tough it would look really cool if could create something with that.

The concept is about a battle between the two in a pos-apocalyptic world, Inicially I didn't had a design or something ready for the design of the site, so everything was just being decided in the moment, really a project just for fun.
